# Flocking can be used to simulate birds, herds, or school of fish.
# Each "boid" in the flock adheres to a simple set of rules:
# - separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates,
# - alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates,
# - cohesion: steer to move toward the average position of local flockmates.

# Create a new flock.
