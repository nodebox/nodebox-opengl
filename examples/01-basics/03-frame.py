# Here is the "Hypnoval", a classic example in NodeBox for Mac OS X.
# It uses the canvas.frame counter to create variation in each frame.
# Math functions sin() and cos() are used to create fluid motion.
# Sine and cosine describe smooth repetitive oscillation between -1 and 1:
# sin(0)=0, sin(pi/2)=1, sin(-pi/2)=-1
# cos(0)=1, cos(pi/2)=0, cos(pi)=-1
# Values near 0 occur more frequently than those near 1 (i.e. "faster" near 1).
