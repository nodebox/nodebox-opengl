    # For example, the "mirror" effect is a very easy way to show off.
    # It reflects the image along a given horizontal (and/or vertical) axis.
    # In this case, we use the mouse position as axes.
    # By piping together many mirrors, we get an interesting kaleidoscopic effect.

    # You may have noticed the fluid, blurry transitions between patterns.
    # This is because we are not clearing the canvas background (we are "painting").
    # Since the image gets drawn with an alpha=0.5 (50% opacity),
    # the new version is constantly pasted on top of the previous version.
