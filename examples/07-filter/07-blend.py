# Blend modes are used to combine the pixels of two images,
# in different ways than standard transparency.
# NodeBox supports the most common blend modes as filters:
# add(), subtract(), darken(), lighten(), multiply(), screen(), overlay(), hue().
# These can be used to adjust the lighting in an image
# (by blending it with a copy of itself),
# or to obtain many creative texturing effects.

            # that define the offset of the blend layer.
