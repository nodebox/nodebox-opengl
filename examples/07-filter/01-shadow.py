# We create a grayscale version of the image with the colorize() filter,
# by reducing the image's R,G,B channels to zero but keeping the alpha channel.
# Then we diffuse it with the blur() filter.
# We create the shadow outside the draw() loop for performance:

    # and then draw the image a bit to the left and to the bottom of it.
