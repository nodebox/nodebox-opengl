# The pixels() command yields a list of pixels from a given image.
# Since this is a relatively slow operation, this is not useful for dynamic image processing,
# but there a various other ways in which pixels can be useful. In short:
# - len(Pixels): the number of pixels in the image.
# - Pixels.width: the width of the image.
# - Pixels.height: the height of the image.
# - Pixels[i]: a list of [R,G,B,A] values between 0-255 that can be modified.
# - Pixels.get(x, y): returns a Color from the pixel at row x and column y.
# - Pixels.set(x, y, clr): sets the color of the pixel at (x,y).
# - Pixels.update() commits all the changes. You can then pass Pixels to the image() command.
