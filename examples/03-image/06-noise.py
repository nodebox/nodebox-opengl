# Create a pixels array from a solid white image:
p = Pixels(solid(200, 200, Color(1)))

# Colorize pixels with the Perlin noise() generator.
# Noise is smoother than random(), comparable to a random gradient.
# This is often used to generate terrain surface maps.

# The noise() command returns a smooth value between -1.0 and 1.0.
# The x, y, z parameters determine the coordinates in the noise landscape. 
# Since the landscape is infinite, the actual value of a coordinate doesn't matter, 
# only the distance between successive steps. 
# The smaller the difference between steps, the smoother the noise sequence. 
# Steps between 0.005 and 0.1 usually work best.
