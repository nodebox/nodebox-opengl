# Since a layer is a rectangular area, all mouse events are also triggered in a rectangle.
# This can be a bit clumsy in some situations. 
# For example: a game environment in which objects light up when the mouse moves over them. 
# Not every object fits in a rectangle - so there will be areas that light up the object
# even if the mouse is not over the actual object.
# If you want to do "hit testing" on irregular areas, you can use BezierPath.contains(x, y).

# BezierPath.contains() returns True when the given position is inside the path.
# However, on the canvas, the path might have been rotated and scaled.
# It may be part of a function, loop, and subject to several intermediary scale() and rotate() calls,
# so that its position and shape on the canvas has become entirely different.
# To check whether a position falls inside a transformed path, we first need to *apply* the transformations.
# This can be done with a Transform object from the geometry module,
# which is like a personal transform state:
#
# from nodebox.geometry import Transform
# path = star(x=50, y=50, points=7, outer=100, draw=False)
# tf = Transform()
# tf.translate(100, 0)
# tf.rotate(45)
# path = tf.transform_path(path)
#
# This effectively modifies the position of all points in the path,
# so that they are translated 100 pixels horizontally and then rotated 45 degrees.
