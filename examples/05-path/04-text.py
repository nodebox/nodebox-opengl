# The classic NodeBox for Mac OS X has an interesting textpath() function
# that transforms a string into a BezierPath.
# This function is partly emulated in NodeBox for OpenGL, as long as 
# you stick with the default fonts (Droid Sans, Droid Sans Mono, Droid Serif).
# Note: there is a way to make more fonts available - see nodebox/font/glyph.py,
# relying on the classic NodeBox to do the calculations.

# Now that we have a BezierPath from the text we can use all sorts of math on it.
# Calculate a list of points (PathElement objects), evenly distributed along the path:
points = list(path.points(1000))
