# The nodebox.gui module provides simple visual controls, such as Slider, Button, CheckBox and Field.
# Each control inherits from a Control class, which in turn inherits from Layer.
# This means that to display a control, we append it to the canvas just like a layer,
# and we set its x and y properties to define its location on the canvas.
