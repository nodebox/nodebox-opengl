# Comparison between Rows and Row containers.
# Both are subclasses of Layout.

# Panel 1
# Controls in a Rows layout are drawn below each other.
# Rows.width defines the width of all controls (individual width is ignored).
# Note how the second Field has a height and wrap=True, 
# which makes it a multi-line field with text wrapping.

    ], width=200)

# Panel 2
# Controls in a Row layout are drawn next to each other.
# Row.width defines the width of all controls (individual width is ignored).
# This means that each column has the same width.
# Note the align=TOP, which vertically aligns each column at the top (default is CENTER).
panel2 = Panel("Panel 2", x=30, y=200)

# Panel 3
# If you need columns of a different width, put a Layout in a column,
# in other words a Row or Rows nested inside a Row or Rows.
# Then put your controls in the nested layout, 
# the layout's width will override the column width setting.

# Panel 4
# Without layouts, you are free to draw controls wherever you want in a panel.
# Panel.pack() will make sure that the panel fits snuggly around the controls.
# In this case, we place a button on the panel, with a field above it (hence y=40).
# The field has its own dimensions (width=300 and height=50).

# Note the reserved=[] with the field.
# By default, fields have ENTER and TAB keys reserved:
# enter fires Field.on_action(), tab moves away from the field.
# By clearing the reserved list we can type enter and tab inside the field.

# Panel 5
# If you don't pack the panel, you have to set its width and height manually,
# as well as the position of all controls:
panel5 = Panel("Panel 5", x=500, y=200, width=200, height=150)
