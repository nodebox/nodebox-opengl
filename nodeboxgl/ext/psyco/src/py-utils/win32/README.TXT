Windows users who want to explore the generated machine code need to download
the following files and put them in this directory:

    objdump.exe:

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/psyco/psyco/py-utils/win32/objdump.exe?rev=1.1&view=auto

    cygwin1.dll:

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/psyco/psyco/py-utils/win32/cygwin1.dll?rev=1.1&view=auto


Both are GPL software distributed (with source) in Red Hat's Cygwin
(http://www.redhat.com/software/cygwin/).

For more information on exploring the machine code see the top-level README.TXT file.
